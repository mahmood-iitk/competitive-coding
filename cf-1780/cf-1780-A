// Problem
Today Hayato came home from school with homework.

In the assignment, Hayato was given an array 𝑎 of length 𝑛. The task was to find 3 numbers in this array whose sum is odd. At school, he claimed that there are such 3 numbers, but Hayato was not sure, so he asked you for help.

Answer if there are such three numbers, and if so, output indices 𝑖 , 𝑗, and 𝑘 such that 𝑎𝑖+𝑎𝑗+𝑎𝑘 is odd.

The odd numbers are integers that are not divisible by 2: 1, 3, 5, and so on.

// Input

The first line contains a single integer 𝑡(1≤𝑡≤10^4) — the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains one integer 𝑛 (3≤𝑛≤300) — the length of 𝑎.

The second line contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤10^5) — the array 𝑎.

It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

// Output

For each test case, in the first line print one word "YES" (without quotes) if there are 3 numbers with an odd sum or "NO" (without quotes) if there are no such 3 numbers.

If the answer exists, then on the second line print 3 distinct integers 𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 (1≤𝑖,𝑗,𝑘≤𝑛) — the indices of the numbers. If there are several answers, output any.

// Example
// Input
6
3
1 1 1
4
1 1 2 2
3
1 2 3
5
1 4 5 1 2
4
2 6 2 4
5
5 6 3 2 1

// Output
YES
1 2 3
YES
3 4 1
NO
YES
1 3 4
NO
YES
1 3 5


// Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	while (t--) {
		int n;
		cin >> n;
		
		vector<pair<int, int>> odd_nums;
		vector<pair<int, int>> even_nums;
		
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
			int num;
			cin >> num;
			if (num % 2 == 0) {
				even_nums.emplace_back(make_pair(num, i));
			} else {
				odd_nums.emplace_back(make_pair(num, i));
			}
		}
		
		if (odd_nums.size() == 0) {
			cout << "NO" << endl;
			continue;
		}
		
		if (odd_nums.size() >= 3) {
			cout << "YES" << endl;
			cout << odd_nums[0].second << " "
				 << odd_nums[1].second << " "
				 << odd_nums[2].second << endl;
			continue;
		}
		
		if (even_nums.size() >= 2) {
			cout << "YES" << endl;
			cout << odd_nums[0].second << " "
				 << even_nums[0].second << " "
				 << even_nums[1].second << endl;
			continue;
		}
		
		cout << "NO" << endl;
	}
}
