// Problem
Mocha likes arrays, and Serval gave her an array consisting of positive integers as a gift.

Mocha thinks that for an array of positive integers 𝑎, it is good iff the greatest common divisor of all the elements in 𝑎 is no more than its length. And for an array of at least 2 positive integers, it is beautiful iff all of its prefixes whose length is no less than 2 are good.

For example: [3,6] is not good, because gcd(3,6)=3 is greater than its length 2.
[1,2,4] is both good and beautiful, because all of its prefixes whose length is no less than 2, which are [1,2] and [1,2,4], are both good.
[3,6,1] is good but not beautiful, because [3,6] is not good. 

Now Mocha gives you the gift array 𝑎 of 𝑛 positive integers, and she wants to know whether array 𝑎 could become beautiful by reordering the elements in 𝑎. It is allowed to keep the array 𝑎 unchanged.

// Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases 𝑡(1≤𝑡≤500). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 𝑛(2≤𝑛≤100) — the length of array 𝑎.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 (1≤𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛≤10^6) — the elements of array 𝑎.

// Output

For each test case, print Yes if it is possible to reorder the elements in 𝑎 to make it beautiful, and print No if not.

You can output Yes and No in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).

// Example
// Input
6
2
3 6
3
1 2 4
3
3 6 1
3
15 35 21
4
35 10 35 14
5
1261 227821 143 4171 1941

// Output
No
Yes
Yes
No
Yes
Yes


// Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	while (t--) {
		int n;
		cin >> n;
		
		int a[n];
		for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
			cin >> a[i];
		}
		
		string res = "NO";
		for (int i = 0; i < n-1; ++i) {
			for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
				int gcd = __gcd(a[i], a[j]);
				if (gcd < 3) {
					res = "YES";
				}
			}
		}
		
		cout << res << endl;
	}
}
