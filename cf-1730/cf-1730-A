// Problem
You are given an array 𝑎 with 𝑛 integers. You can perform the following operation at most 𝑘 times:

    Choose two indices 𝑖 and 𝑗, in which 𝑖 mod 𝑘 =𝑗 mod 𝑘 (1≤𝑖<𝑗≤𝑛). Swap 𝑎𝑖and 𝑎𝑗. 

After performing all operations, you have to select 𝑘 consecutive elements, and the sum of the 𝑘 elements becomes your score. Find the maximum score you can get.
Here 𝑥 mod 𝑦 denotes the remainder from dividing 𝑥 by 𝑦.

// Input

The first line contains one integer 𝑡(1≤𝑡≤600) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line of each test case contains two integers 𝑛 and 𝑘 (1≤𝑘≤𝑛≤100) — the length of the array and the number in the statement above.

The second line of each test case contains 𝑛 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛 (0≤𝑎𝑖≤109)  — the array itself.

// Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define ll long long

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while(t--) {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    
    vector<ll> num(n + 1);
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      cin >> num[i];
    }
    
    ll res = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
      ll max_value = 0;
      for (int j = i; j <= n; j = j + k) {
        max_value = max(max_value, num[j]);
      }
      res += max_value; 
    }
    
    cout << res << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
