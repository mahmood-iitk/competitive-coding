// Problem
For his birthday, Kevin received the set of pairwise distinct numbers 1,2,3,…,𝑛 as a gift.
He is going to arrange these numbers in a way such that the minimum absolute difference between two consecutive numbers be maximum possible. More formally, if he arranges numbers in order 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛, he wants to maximize the value
min𝑖=1𝑛−1|𝑝𝑖+1−𝑝𝑖|,
where |𝑥| denotes the absolute value of 𝑥.

Help Kevin to do that.

// Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer 𝑡(1≤𝑡≤100) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains an integer 𝑛(2≤𝑛≤1000) — the size of the set.

// Output

For each test case print a single line containing 𝑛 distinct integers 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛 (1≤𝑝𝑖≤𝑛) describing the arrangement that maximizes the minimum absolute difference of consecutive elements.

Formally, you have to print a permutation 𝑝 which maximizes the value min𝑖=1𝑛−1|𝑝𝑖+1−𝑝𝑖|.
If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.

// Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int t;
  cin >> t;
  while(t--) {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int m = n / 2;
    
    for (int i = m; i >= 1; i = i - 1) {
      cout << i << " " << i + m << " ";
    }
    
    if (m * 2 != n) {
      cout << n;
    }
    cout << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
